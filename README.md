# Betal-Code
Betal-Code is a web application which aims at recommending new and interesting coding problems to it's user(Vikram) and the process continues.... ;p

Switching to the next problem after submitting a code is not a big task but doing that to an adequate problem is difficult.
To know about a problem's tags, difficulty and other user's review, and then select it to solve is a tough task, hence we solve questions randomly. How about letting a machine do this job for us!!

> The task is to create a Betal which never stops recommending adequate problems to it's Vikram and each time the problems get better.
> Multiple types of recommendation engines will operate in Betal-Code and Vikram can choose which type of recommedation to take.

## Systems available to use for recommendation
* Collaborative Recommender System
* Content based Recommender System
* Hybrid Recommender System
* Knowledge based Recommender System

## Machine Learning Techniques available to Build Recommendation Engine
* k-nearest neighbours approach
* Association Rules appraoch
* Matrix Factorisation approach
* Deep NeuralNetworks approach

*Any other techniques or systems are welcome as feature requests in Issues*

## Prerequisites
* Machine Learning(*Knowledge of Recommender System is enough*)
* Web-App Development(*Django is preferred*)

**Prior Knowledge of above prerequisites is not *mandatory* and can be learnt while development. Mentors can also help you out**

**To make this project possible we will use [*Codeforces Api*](https://codeforces.com/api/help)**

## Steps for Betal-Code development
1. Data Collection and Cleaning 
2. Fitting a Recommendation Engine
3. Deploying on Web-App

*Candidates can choose which steps they want to work on*

1. **Data Colection and Cleaning**
     * Keeping in mind the data available at the codeforces api and the recommendation engine choosed, appropriate data is fetched, cleaned and stored in form of csv or xls.
2. **Fitting a Recommendation Engine**
     * Make your Betal by training on the dataset stored.
3. **Deploying on Web-App**
     * Deploy the trained engine on a web-app that asks it's user for sufficient information and then recommend problems and also takes feedback for the recommended problems and then use this data to improve further recommendations.(*For example, a collaborative system would require it's user to provide thier codeforces username and then recommend*)

## Contribution
You can contact mentors regarding your *visualisation and techniques* to solve the problem and for contribution to this project.
You can make pull requests if you want to contribute.
