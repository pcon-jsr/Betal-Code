# Betal-Code
Betal-Code is a web application which aims at recommending new and interesting coding problems to it's user(Vikram) and the process continues.... ;p

Switching to the next problem after submitting a code is not a big task but doing that to an adequate problem is difficult.
To know about a problem's tags, difficulty and other user's review, and then select it to solve is a tough task, hence we solve questions randomly. How about letting a machine do this job for us!!

> The task is to create a Betal which never stops recommending adequate problems to it's Vikram and each time the problems get better.
> Multiple types of recommendation engines will operate in Betal-Code and Vikram can choose which type of recommedation to take.

## Systems to use for recommendation
1.Collaborative Recommender System
2.Content based Recommender System
3.Hybrid Recommender System
4.Knowledge based Recommender System

## Machine Learning Techniques to Build Recommendation Engine
1.k-nearest neighbours approach
2.Association Rules appraoch
3.Matrix Factorisation approach
4.Deep NeuralNetworks approach

*Any other techniques or systems are welcome as feature requests in Issues*

## Prerequisites
* Machine Learning
* Web-App Development

**Prior Knowledge of above prerequisites is not *mandatory* and can be learnt while development. Mentors can also help you out**

**To make this project possible we will use *Codeforces Api***

## Steps for Betal-Code development
1. Data Collection and Cleaning 
2. Fitting a Recommendation Engine
3. Deploying on Web-App
*Candidates can choose which steps they want to work on*
